# Exclusion Criteria Reference - B.56 Programme

## Treatment Duration

Treatment continues until physician decides to exclude patient based on criteria below.

## Progression Criteria

### PSA Progression Definition

All THREE must be met:
1. Three consecutive PSA rises
2. Measurements at least 1 week apart
3. Two rises ≥50% above nadir (lowest value during treatment)
4. Absolute PSA >2 ng/mL

**Exception**: Treatment may continue despite PSA progression if:
- Documented clinical benefit exists
- Next-line therapy is not indicated or not possible
- Decision documented by treating physician

### Radiological Progression Definition

**Soft Tissue (RECIST criteria):**
- ≥20% increase in sum of target lesion diameters
- New lesions appearing

**Bone (PCWG criteria):**
- ≥2 new lesions on bone scan
- Confirmed on follow-up scan ≥6 weeks later

## Performance Status Deterioration

### Drugs Requiring ECOG 0-1 at Baseline
*Apalutamide (nmCRPC), Darolutamide (nmCRPC), Enzalutamide (nmCRPC, mCRPC pre-docetaxel)*

**Exclusion**: Sustained deterioration to ECOG 2-4

### Drugs Allowing ECOG 0-2 at Baseline
*Apalutamide (mHSPC), Darolutamide (mHSPC), Enzalutamide (mHSPC, mCRPC post-docetaxel), Olaparib, Niraparib+Abiraterone, Talazoparib+Enzalutamide*

**Exclusion**: Sustained deterioration to ECOG 3-4

## Other Exclusion Criteria

### 1. Hypersensitivity
- To any active substance in the treatment
- To any excipient in the formulation

### 2. Toxicity
- Requiring permanent discontinuation per physician judgment
- Requiring permanent discontinuation per SmPC guidance

### 3. Intercurrent Conditions
- Any disease or condition that, in physician's opinion, precludes continued treatment

### 4. Quality of Life
- Clinically significant QoL deterioration during treatment

### 5. Non-Compliance
Patient non-compliance with:
- Treatment regimen
- Follow-up appointments
- Required monitoring tests (safety or efficacy)

## Drug-Specific Exclusion Notes

### Apalutamide / Enzalutamide (nmCRPC, mCRPC)
- Development of seizures
- Development of conditions predisposing to seizures

### PARP Inhibitors (Olaparib, Niraparib+Abiraterone, Talazoparib)
- CrCl falling to ≤30 mL/min
- Myelodysplastic syndrome
- Acute myeloid leukemia
