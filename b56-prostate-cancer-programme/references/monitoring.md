## Efficacy Monitoring

### PSA Monitoring
| Setting | Minimum Frequency | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| All drugs | Every 3 months | May be more frequent per clinical indication |

### Imaging Monitoring
| Modality | Minimum Frequency | Notes |
|----------|------------------|-------|
| Same as baseline (CT/MRI/X-ray) | Every 6 months | Match baseline imaging method |
| Bone scintigraphy | Every 6 months | Required for all patients |

**Clinical Suspicion of Progression**: Perform imaging immediately regardless of schedule.

## Response Assessment Criteria

### For Soft Tissue Lesions
Use current **RECIST criteria**

### For Bone Lesions
Use **PCWG criteria**

## Reportable Efficacy Outcomes

Physicians must report (where determinable for individual patient):
- CR (Complete Response)
- PR (Partial Response) or nonCR/nonPD
- SD (Stable Disease) or nonCR/nonPD
- PD (Progressive Disease)
- OS (Overall Survival) or PFS (Progression-Free Survival)

## Darolutamide + Docetaxel Specific Timeline

For mHSPC patients:
1. Start darolutamide
2. Begin docetaxel within 6 weeks of darolutamide start
3. Planned: 6 cycles of docetaxel
4. Continue darolutamide:
   - Even if docetaxel delayed
   - Even if docetaxel discontinued early
   - Until progression or unacceptable toxicity

## Dose Modification Guidance

Follow current Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC/ChPL) for:
- Temporary treatment holds
- Dose reductions
- Permanent discontinuation criteria

### Renal Function-Based Adjustments (PARP Inhibitors)

| CrCl (mL/min) | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| >50 | Standard dosing |
| 31-50 | Dose reduction per SmPC |
| ≤30 | **Drug contraindicated** |
