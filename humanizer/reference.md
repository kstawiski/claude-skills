## Pattern Detection Rules

### 1. Inflated Symbolism

**Definition:** Overly dramatic metaphors and symbolic language that feels disconnected from the actual content.

**Detection Signals:**
- Metaphors involving light/darkness, journeys, tapestries, symphonies

**Examples to Fix:**

| AI Pattern | Issue | Human Alternative |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| "a beacon of hope illuminating the path forward" | Overwrought metaphor | "a promising approach" |
| "weaving together the threads of innovation" | Unnecessary symbolism | "combining different innovations" |
| "standing at the crossroads of history" | Dramatic inflation | "at an important decision point" |
| "the dawn of a new era" | Clichéd grandeur | "a significant change" |
| "a tapestry of interconnected ideas" | Forced metaphor | "related ideas" |

**When Acceptable:** Creative writing, motivational content, speeches (use sparingly).

- Action verbs: "unlock", "unleash", "supercharge", "turbocharge"
- Compound hype: "cutting-edge", "state-of-the-art", "game-changing"
- Promise language: "transform", "revolutionize", "reimagine"

**Examples to Fix:**

| AI Pattern | Issue | Human Alternative |

**Examples to Fix:**

| AI Pattern | Issue | Human Alternative |

| "showcasing the ability to process data" | Passive description | "This system processes data by..." |
| "underscoring the need for collaboration" | No substance | "Teams must collaborate to..." |
| "demonstrating the power of AI" | Empty claim | "AI achieved X result by..." |

| "It is worth noting that..." | Filler | State the point directly |
| "It is important to note that..." | Padding | Just state it |
| "In conclusion, we have shown..." | Formulaic | "We showed..." or "The evidence shows..." |
| "To summarize, the key findings are..." | Obvious | Just list findings |

**Guidelines:**
- Maximum 1-2 formal transitions per page

- Often transitions can be removed entirely

---

## Additional AI Indicators

### Sentence Structure Patterns

**AI tends to:**
- Start many sentences with "This" referring to previous sentence
- Use consistent sentence length (little variation)
- Follow predictable paragraph structures
- Avoid contractions ("do not" vs "don't")

**Human writing:**
- Varies sentence length
- Uses contractions naturally
- Has less predictable structure
- Includes occasional incomplete sentences or fragments for effect

### Hedging Patterns

**AI overuses:**
- "may", "might", "could", "potentially"
- "It is possible that..."
- "There is a chance that..."

**Fix:** Be more direct when confidence is warranted. Use hedging only when genuinely uncertain.

### Enthusiasm Markers

**AI patterns:**
- Exclamation points in formal writing
- "Exciting", "fascinating", "remarkable" as filler
- Emotional reactions to data

**Fix:** Let facts speak for themselves. Reserve enthusiasm for genuinely surprising findings.
