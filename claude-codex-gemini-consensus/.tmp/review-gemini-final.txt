VERDICT: NEEDS_CHANGES
ISSUES: 
- scripts/blinded-consensus.sh: The `sed` fallback for anonymization (lines 485-488) lacks word boundaries, causing potential text corruption (e.g., "alias Claude" -> "aliAs a reviewer").
- scripts/review.sh, scripts/consensus-review.sh, scripts/blinded-consensus.sh: Significant code duplication for `run_with_timeout` and `read_input_content` functions complicates maintenance.
